St. Xavier’s shared its facilities with St. Robert’s Boys High School. In 1982, St. Xavier’s applied for and was granted affiliation with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi. In 1984 the first batch of students appeared for the Secondary School Examination conducted by CBSE. Fr. Dwyer was succeeded by Fr. Bernie Donnelly in 1985.
