<h3>Welcome to
Oasis School</h3>
<p>Oasis School, Hazaribag was established in response to multiples request from various communities of Hazaribagh to cater to the modern educational need of thousands of students hailing from the economically weak and backward sections of the society. Al-Hamd education and Welfare Trust decided to shoulder this noble responsibility of carrying the torch of enlightenment in the bleak corners of the society where people were desirous of educating their wards in modern English Medium School but were lagging clubbed behind to afford the high cost of modern education.</p>
